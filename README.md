# OpenVPN Installer
Welcome to possibly the easiest OpenVPN installer ever. This script lets you convert a brand new VPS into an OpenVPN server in a few minutes.

## Usage
Pretty much all you need to do is run the script, and fill out some information. The defaults will be fine for most people, so if you're unsure, just use those. You can download and run the script by running the following as root:

```shell
wget wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NerdOfLinux/OpenVPN-Installer/master/OpenVPN.sh
bash OpenVPN.sh
```

## Need a VPS?
You can get one for as little as $5 a month from DigitalOcean. If you use my [referral link](https://m.do.co/c/f941d4888bfb), you'll get $50 of credit to use over 30 days. Once you spend $25, I also get $25 (at no extra cost to you), so it's a win/win. I personally use DigitalOcean for my own VPN server, and have no complaints.

**Note**: This script is based off of the [OpenVPN road warrior](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install) installer.
