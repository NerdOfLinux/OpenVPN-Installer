# Deprecated
The [original script](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install) has added most of the missing funcionality that caused me to create this script, and as such I don't really see a need to keep maintaining this one. Additionally, I haven't really had the time to keep this up to date, so I believe the most responsible thing to do is to archive this repository and direct everyone to the original script which is still being actively maintained.
