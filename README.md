# OpenVPN Installer
Welcome to possibly the easiest OpenVPN installer ever. This script lets you convert a brand new VPS into an OpenVPN server in a few minutes.

## Usage
Pretty much all you need to do is run the script, and fill out some information. The defaults will be fine for most people, so if you're unsure, just use those. You can download and run the script by running the following as root:

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NerdOfLinux/OpenVPN-Installer/master/OpenVPN.sh
bash OpenVPN.sh
```

## Need a VPS?
You can get one from [Linode](https://www.linode.com/?r=d6895526122580c950ca478860b1715f56e9c75d) or [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/f941d4888bfb) for as little as $5/month! If you're on a budget, you can even get a VPS from [Vultr](https://www.vultr.com/?ref=8383848-6G) for as little as $3.50/month. Please note that using the given links to Linode, DigitalOcean, and Vultr will help me out at no extra cost to you.

**Note**: This script is based off of the [OpenVPN road warrior](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install) installer.
